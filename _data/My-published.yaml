    Motivation: Repeated cross-sectional time series single cell data confound
    several sources of variation, with contributions from measurement noise,
    stochastic cell-to-cell variation and cell progression at different rates.
    Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to
    confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells.
    When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated
    and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression.

    Results: We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian
    inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method’s utility
    on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq datasets from three organisms.
    Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an
    Arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a
    human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious
    cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells.
    Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art
    technique. We also show using held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal
    dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of
    repeated cross-sectional time series.

    Availability and Implementation: Our method is available on CRAN in the
    DeLorean package.

  abstract: "Motif finding is a difficult problem that has been studied for over 20 years. Some older popular motif finders are not suitable for analysis of the large data sets generated by next-generation sequencing. We recently published an efficient approximation (STEME) to the EM algorithm that is at the core of many motif finders such as MEME. This approximation allows the EM algorithm to be applied to large data sets. In this work we describe several efficient extensions to STEME that are based on the MEME algorithm. Together with the original STEME EM approximation, these extensions make STEME a fully-fledged motif finder with similar properties to MEME. We discuss the difficulty of objectively comparing motif finders. We show that STEME performs comparably to existing prominent discriminative motif finders, DREME and Trawler, on 13 sets of transcription factor binding data in mouse ES cells. We demonstrate the ability of STEME to find long degenerate motifs which these discriminative motif finders do not find. As part of our method, we extend an earlier method due to Nagarajan et al. for the efficient calculation of motif E-values. STEME's source code is available under an open source license and STEME is available via a web interface."

  title: Nodal cis-regulatory elements reveal epiblast and primitive endoderm heterogeneity in the peri-implantation mouse embryo

  abstract: 'Nodal, a secreted factor known for its conserved functions in cell-fate specification and the establishment of embryonic axes, is also required in mammals to maintain the pluripotency of the epiblast, the tissue that gives rise to all fetal lineages. Although Nodal is expressed as early as E3.5 in the mouse embryo, its regulation and functions at pre- and peri-implantation stages are currently unknown. Sensitive reporter transgenes for two Nodal cis-regulatory regions, the PEE and the ASE, exhibit specific expression profiles before implantation. Mutant and inhibitor studies find them respectively regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Activin/Nodal signaling, and provide evidence for localized and heterogeneous activities of these pathways in the inner cell mass, the epiblast and the primitive endoderm. These studies also show that Nodal and its prime effector, FoxH1, are not essential to preimplantation Activin/Nodal signaling. Finally, a strong upregulation of the ASE reporter in implanting blastocysts correlates with a downregulation of the pluripotency factor Nanog in the maturing epiblast. This study uncovers conservation in the mouse blastocyst of Wnt/β-catenin and Activin/Nodal-dependent activities known to govern Nodal expression and the establishment of polarity in the blastula of other deuterostomes. Our results indicate that these pathways act early on to initiate distinct cell-specification processes in the ICM derivatives. Our data also suggest that the activity of the Activin/Nodal pathway is dampened by interactions with the molecular machinery of pluripotency until just before implantation, possibly delaying cell-fate decisions in the mouse embryo.'

  title: Conserved cis-regulatory modules control robustness in Msx1 expression at single cell resolution
  container-title: Genome Biology and Evolution
  page: evv179
  source: gbe.oxfordjournals.org
  abstract: 'The process of transcription is highly stochastic leading to cell-to-cell variations and noise in gene expression levels. However, key essential genes have to be precisely expressed at the correct amount and time to ensure proper cellular development and function. Studies in yeast and bacterial systems have shown that gene expression noise decreases as mean expression levels increase, a relationship that is controlled by promoter DNA sequence. However, the function of distal cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), an evolutionary novelty of metazoans, in controlling transcriptional robustness and variability is poorly understood. In this study, we used live cell imaging of transfected reporters combined with a mathematical modelling and statistical inference scheme, to quantify the function of conserved Msx1 CRMs and promoters in modulating single cell real time transcription rates in C2C12 mouse myoblasts. The results show that the mean expression-noise relationship is solely promoter controlled for this key pluripotency regulator. In addition, we demonstrate that CRMs modulate single cell basal promoter rate distributions in a graded manner across a population of cells. This extends the rheostatic model of CRM action to provide a more detailed understanding of CRM function at single cell resolution. We also identify a novel CRM transcriptional filter function that acts to reduce intracellular variability in transcription rates and show that this can be phylogenetically separable from rate modulating CRM activities. These results are important for understanding how the expression of key vertebrate developmental transcription factors is precisely controlled both within and between individual cells.'

  title: Probabilistic models of transcriptional regulation

  genre: PhD
  abstract: >-
    Regulation of transcription lies at the heart of many of the most critical
    cellular behaviours. This regulation is mediated by the binding of
    transcription factors to the

    genome. There is much uncertainty about many aspects of this process.
    Firstly, individual transcription factors preferentially bind to a variety of
    genomic sequences. Even

    when these preferences are known, predicting transcription factor binding
    sites has a high

    false positive rate. Secondly, the sequence preferences of many transcription
    factors are

    uncharacterised. Biological experiments only provide indirect evidence of
    transcription

    factor binding. The task of inferring the sequence preferences given these
    indirect data

    is difficult. Thirdly, transcription factors do not operate in isolation.
    Sets of interacting

    transcription factors are reused across distinct cellular programs. Many of
    these cellular programs and sets of transcription factors remain to be
    characterised. This thesis

    uses probabilistic modelling techniques to present three contributions that
    address the

    aforementioned uncertainty about transcriptional regulation.

    I describe a novel method that uses conservation of genomic sequences between
    related

    species to improve predictions of transcription factor binding. Unlike other
    similar

    methods, a multiple alignment of the regions of interest is not required.

    Some of the most popular and best methods for characterising the sequence
    binding

    preferences of transcription factors are not able to handle data sets of the
    size generated

    by recent biological techniques. I present a novel technique that uses suffix
    trees to

    speed up one of the most popular existing techniques so that it can be
    applied to much

    larger data sets.

    I present a hierarchical non-parametric probabilistic model that captures
    interactions

    between transcription factors and their target genes. This model infers
    several well

    established interactions between transcription factors in an unsupervised
    setting.

    Taken together these methods demonstrate how apposite probabilistic modelling
    techniques are for quantifying uncertainty in transcriptional regulation.
